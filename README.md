This is my conceptual project that provides functionality to city tourists and citizens. I come up to develop it to study basic web development so don't judge it too much :). Also I am not a good designer but I did my best. Any suggestions are welcome.

The idea of project is to help both tourist and citizens navigate the city.
Through this web application alows users to:
  - Register accounts
  - Have a basic settings page(avatars, bio)

Also there are features in plan to realise:
  - Messeging
  - Services order and Cart
  - User ranking (Admin, Moderator, Publisher)
  - Managing content (Publishing posts, events and so on...)
  - Commenting on posts
